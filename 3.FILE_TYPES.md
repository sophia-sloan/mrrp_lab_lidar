# LIDAR File Types & Storage 

## Overview

These are following most common file types encountered when working with LIDAR data.

## File Types

### .las

.las is designed for organizing and archiving data in vector format. Originally developed by ASPRS and initially released in 2007, .las is an open, binary format and is standard for LIDAR data in a vectorized format. A .las file consists of the following sections:

1. Public header block: .las file header, specifies number of points, point cloud extent, etc.

2. Variable length records (VLR): optional records, such as spatial refernece system, and metadata. Up to 65535 bytes in length.

3. Point data records: contains the actual data for each point in the point cloud. This contains a point's coordinates, classification, and other information.

4. Extended variable length records (EVLR): added in a later version of LAS, EVLR is a continuation of VLR and allow a bigger payload.

### .laz

.laz is a compressed version of the .las file format. Reduces file size up to ninety percent without data loss. Direct use is typically supported by most LIDAR tools, and decompression is done automatically. However, it is slower to use than .las due to delay from decompression. Data is typically stored in this format.

### .tiff

.tiff, also known as the Tag Image File Format, is a general use image file format for storing raster images. It was initially released in 1986.

### .geotiff

.geotiff builds off of the .tiff file format, with additional metadata standards. DEMs generated from LIDAR data are typically stored in this format. Georeferencing information is embedded in a .tiff file to ensure consistency with other geodata and establish a file's spacial reference. .geotiff files can also be read with software intended for processing or manipulating .tiff files, but will be unable to process its accompanying files, which are:

* .tfw: gives the raster a geolocation.

* .xml: metadata.

* .aux: store projections.

* .ovr: optimizes raster display.

### .txt

.txt is a plaintext, ASCII format. It is easy to view, directly edit, and create custom software to manipulate data (both .las and .tiff files are incomprehensible if opened with a text editor, besides the header data). However, file size grows quickly due to being stored in an ASCII format and does not reinforce a strict structure.

## Conclusions

.las is industry standard for LIDAR vector data due to its smaller file sizes, reliability, and wide support with tools such as LASTools and QGIS. .tiff/.geotiff are popular formats for creating DEMs from LIDAR data, particularly .geotiff which ensures consistency across other collected geodata. .txt works best with small, specialized projects with small data sets.
