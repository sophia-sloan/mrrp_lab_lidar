# Vector and Raster

## Overview

LIDAR data is typically stored in one of two ways: vector or raster format. Both of these types are commonly used in the storing and manipulation of LIDAR data, although vectors or rasters are applied to different use cases.

## Vectors and Rasters

### Vector

Vectors are commonly used in computer graphics (.svg). For example, modern fonts generally consist of vectors: this ensures that no matter how the font is scaled, it always appears crisp.

In vector formats, points are stored as x and y coordinates with a spatial reference frame, also referred to as a horizontal datum. Vector files can consist of vertices and paths with three symbol types: points, lines, and polygons. Since data is independent of a predetermined grid size, there is a higher geographic accuracy than raster formats.

Vectors are a common choice for creating data models, however vector manipulation is expensive and typically requires generalization to properly display and store data.

### Raster

Rasters are also commonly used in computer graphics (.jpg, .png). However, unlike vectors, they will not maintain the same crispness if the image is enlarged.

In raster formats, data is stored as pixels, or cells of a grid. Typically, these are regularly spaced and square grids. Each pixel is additionally assigned a classification.

There are two types of rasters: discrete and continuous. Discrete rasters can represent objects where it is clearly defined where it is and where it is not: for example, a discrete raster for terrain that contains a river would consist of cells that either do or don't represent water. Continuous rasters alternatively are able to represent objects where there is a spectrum, such as a raster which categorizes points based off of the altitude of the terrain. Essentially, discrete rasters can represent 0 or 1: either it is there or it is not, while continuous rasters are able to represent 0-1 (inclusively).

Since rasters are essentially stored as a two-dimensional matrix, performing map algebra on a raster is fast with both discrete and continuous rasters. However, it is difficult to display linear features and paths due to its format. Similarly, topology rules, which refers to utilizing points, polygons, and lines to define relationships between features, cannot be performed on rasters.

Files also grow very large with rasters, compared to vectors.

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Canopy Height Models (CHM) are represented as rasters.

### Conversion

Open-source tools such as QGIS (refer to section 3) can be used to convert between the two types. However, conversion almost always entails some data loss.

Vectorization refers to the process of converting from raster to vector, and rasterization refers to the process of converting from vector to raster.

## Conclusions

Vector formats are best for performing topology rules on a LIDAR data set and creating data models, but manipulating vectors is expensive. Raster formats are best for creating DEMs and performing map algebra.
