# A1M8 Quick Start

## Connecting the A1M8

The A1M8 has a range up to six meters and is best used for indoor or small-scale scans.

Follow the instructions which come with the A1M8 for connecting the A1M8 to a computer. Important to note that the A1M8 does not come with a micro USB cable, and interacting with serial devices may require privileges. A1 is also analogous to A1M8 in Slamtec documentation.

The sensor should begin to spin immediately after plugging it in. If this is not the case, check that every component is securely connected.

On Linux, typically the A1M8 is connected over /dev/ttyUSB0. This can be checked with the following command and finding the most recently connected serial device:

##
    dmesg | grep tty

On Windows, typically the A1M8 is connected over COM3 or COM4.

There are two options covered below for the A1M8:

1. RoboStudio: recommended if only evaluation of LIDAR data collected with the A1M8 is needed. Requires Windows or Android.

2. Slamtec RPLIDAR SDK: open-source and written in C++, also has an open-source ROS node which can be used directly. It supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## RoboStudio

[RoboStudio](https://www.slamtec.com/en/robostudio) is downloaded on the Windows computer in the lab.

You will need to register for an account, and verify your email. When I did this the link for verification as broken, expired, or invalid even after several attempts; RoboStudio still allowed me to log in, regardless.

You will then enter the main menu for RoboStudio.

Click on the button labeled "Lidars" in the top left corner.

Move your cursor to the pane that appears on the left side of the application, right-click, and select the drop-down option "Manual Connect to Lidar".

Select which USB the Lidar is connected to (typically COM3 or COM4).

Exit from the Lidars pane and click on the "Start Scan" button to beginning scanning with the A1M8.

Data gathered can be exported, but only in plain ASCII format.

## Slamtec RPLIDAR SDK

[Slamtec RPLIDAR SDK](https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_sdk) has instructions detailing set up.

Clone the repository, then navigate to the root directory and enter the following command:

##
    make

Afterwards, navigate to the compiled result at output/Linux/Release.

In order to run the examples, you will need to pass the following fields as arguments, for example:

##
    ./ultra_simple --channel --serial /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

The first two arguments indicate that it is a serial channel, the third is the serial port device, and the last argument is the baudrate, which is the speed of communication.

The result should output a stream of data as it is being read from the sensor.
