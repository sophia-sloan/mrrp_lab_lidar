# LIDAR Software

## QGIS

Supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

[QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/introduction/getting_started.html) is a popular open-source tool for processing LIDAR data files of both vector and raster formats.

QGIS sometimes does not work well with the .laz file format, but .laz can be decompressed to .las using LAStools. This can cause files to be considerably larger (one .laz file expanded from 200 MB to 1.5 GB, this way).

Supports importing LASTools into QGIS.

## LASTools

Supported on Windows and Linux.

[LASTools](https://lastools.github.io/) is a somewhat dated but nonetheless very powerful set of somewhat open-source tools for processing LIDAR data files primarily of .las or .laz format. Helpful as a backup or alternative to QGIS.
