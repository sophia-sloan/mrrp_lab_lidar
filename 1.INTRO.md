# Basics of LIDAR

## Overview

LIDAR, or light detection and ranging, is a method for determining the range from an object or surface with a laser, by measuring the time taken for the light from the laser to return to the receiver after being reflected off of the object or surface. This is evaluated with the following formula:

d = (c * t) / 2

Where d is distance, c is the speed of light, and t is time taken for the light to return to the receiver.

## LIDAR Data Processing

Processing LIDAR data can be simplified to filtering, classification, then visualization, though may differ depending on the application of the data. Such applications can include creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which is a raster representation of a surface, or a classified point cloud, where points are given specific classifications.

1. Filtering: refers to the process of removing noise and other erroneous pointers that are outliers from the point cloud. RANSAC, also referred to as random sample consensus, is one method to filter LIDAR data. One example application of RANSAC is fitting a line from a two-dimensional data set. This can be an iterative process to repeatedly filter the point cloud.

2. Classification: the process of assigning labels to points within the point cloud. Examples of labels within a point cloud could be buildings, ground, water, etc.

3. Visualization: utilizing a filtered and classified point cloud, a model can be constructed from it and analyzed.
