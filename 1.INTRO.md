# Basics of LIDAR

## Overview

LIDAR, or light detection and ranging, is a method for determining the range from an object or surface with a laser, by measuring the time taken for the light from the laser to return to the receiver after being reflected off of the object or surface. This is evaluated with the following formula:

d = (c * t) / 2

Where d is distance, c is the speed of light, and t is time taken for the light to return to the receiver.

## Components

### Laser

The laser component emits the light that is used to measure the range from an object or surface from the source of the laser. There are different types of light that a laser can emit depending on the application of the sensor. For example, most terrestrial LIDAR applications use a near-infrared wavelength, which is eye-safe. A laser can be either of fixed position or can oscillate and rapidly emit lasers.

### Detector

The detector receives the light after it has reflected off the object or surface and returns in the direction of where the laser came from.

### Processing Unit

The processing unit handles the process of receiving data from the detector and calculating the distance of the surface or object from the laser (distance), and the angle of laser when it emitted the beam of light (Î¸). Additional processing would be necessary to convert this to cartesian coordinates.

### Additional Components

A LIDAR sensor may also include an inertial measurement unit (IMU), or global positioning system (GPS). Georeferencing, which is the process of translating a data set to a coordinate location on earth, works best with both of these components.

## LIDAR Data Processing

Processing LIDAR data can be simplified to filtering, classification, then visualization, though may differ depending on the application of the data. Such applications can include creating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which is a raster representation of a surface, or a classified point cloud, where points are given specific classifications.

1. Filtering: refers to the process of removing noise and other erroneous pointers that are outliers from the point cloud. RANSAC, also referred to as random sample consensus, is one method to filter LIDAR data. One example application of RANSAC is fitting a line from a two-dimensional data set. This can be an iterative process to repeatedly filter the point cloud.

2. Classification: the process of assigning labels to points within the point cloud. Examples of labels within a point cloud could be buildings, ground, water, etc.

3. Visualization: utilizing a filtered and classified point cloud, a model can be constructed from it and analyzed.
